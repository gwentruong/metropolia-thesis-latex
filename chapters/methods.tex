\chapter{Methodology}

There are two aspects of this thesis project. First aspect is to perform a comparative testing to determine the possibility to commercialize Voxer. Second aspect is to produce materials for supporting theory of Voxer. However, since there is limitation of equipments and softwares, mainly comparative testing is able to be done. Data and analysis acquired from the test can be used to support basic theory of Voxer from Experimental Fluid Dynamics point of view and to create database to advance the study further with Computational Fluid Dynamics or with mathematical model later in the future.

Comparative testing is a process of measuring properties of performance of the product. The primary element which constitutes an objective comparative test program is the extent to which the researchers can perform tests with independence from the manufacturers, suppliers, and marketers of the products \cite{test:book}. In this project, we performed the comparative testing on Voxer at Keravan Energy for the commissioner SansOx Ltd. in order to provide data for scientific and engineering purposes; subject product to stresses and dynamic expected in use.
