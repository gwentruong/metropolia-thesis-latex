 Reducing energy dissipation inside a tube in fluid process engineering is one of the key factors to improve the efficiency of an industrial process. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to reduce fluid energy dissipation by utilizing a half elliptical blade wing named Voxer from \gls{ltd} inside a pipeline. The project was carried out by performing comparative testing on replication models of pipeline section belonging to water cooling system at Keravan Energy's biomass power plant. The Voxer inherits features from static mixer to create vortex current and has innovative characteristics to act as a cost-effective add-on solution for existing pipeline systems. 
 \newline
  
Fluid Flow experimentation on Voxer by measuring pressure drop shows that with the correct position of Voxer in the system, raising of vortex flow reduces pressure drop, which is proportional with decreasing energy losses in the fluid.
